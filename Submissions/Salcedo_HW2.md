# Forecast description

For this week, I decided to use the information for a dry year which daily flow magnitude was very similar to 2020, as for Forecast 1. In addition, given that the information for week between Aug. 31 and Sept. 6 is available now, I decided to update the forecast by multiplying the dry year weekly average by a value of 0.966, corresponding to the ratio between 2020/2009 (dry year) to represent the difference between both years.
