Hi! Please follow these instructions to execute my code and submit my forecast on next Monday.

1. Download as usual the flow dataset from USGS for Station 09506000 considering the time period between 1989-01-01 to 2020-10-10. Copy and paste the information in the file *"streamflow_week7.txt"* available in my _Data_ folder.

2. Look for the Cell starting in Line 93. Run all the above.

3. Run the aforementioned Cell to get the forecasts for Week 1 and 2. Please submit the output of my AR Model (printed in this step) to the competition.

4. Execute the last cell (starting in Line 144) to get a plot for the time series and the forecasts.

Thank you!
