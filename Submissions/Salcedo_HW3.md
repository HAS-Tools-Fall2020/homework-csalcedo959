# Forecast description

As in the previous forecasts, I decided to use a dry year similar in magnitude to 2020. In this sense, I got the average flow of Verde River between January 01 and August 01 for both 2009 and 2020, and determine a correction factor of 1.542 approximately. Based on this, I decided to update the forecast by multiplying the dry year weekly average by the correction factor. Using more data in this test didn't seem to works well.
