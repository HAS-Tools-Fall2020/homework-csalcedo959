# Forecast Week 3
## *Name:* Camilo Salcedo

# Forecast description

As in the previous forecasts, I decided to use a dry year similar in magnitude to 2020. In this sense, I got the average flow of Verde River between January 01 and August 01 for both 2009 and 2020, and determine a correction factor of 1.542 approximately. Based on this, I decided to update the forecast by multiplying the dry year weekly average by the correction factor.

#Assignment Questions
##1. Describe the variables flow, year, month, and day. What type of objects are they, what are they composed of, and how long are they?
### Flow:
List of daily measured flow in Verde River between 01-01-1989 and 12-09-2020 in cfs. Float type. Length of 11579 elements.
### Year:
List of the variable "year" of the measurements. An integer between 1989 and 2020. Integer type. Length of 11579 elements.
### Month:
List of the variable "month" of the measurements. An integer between 1 and 12.  Integer type. Length of 11579 elements.
### Day:
List of the variable "day" of the measurements. An integer between 1 and 31.  Integer type. Length of 11579 elements.

##2. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?


##3. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)


##4. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?
